# Symptomdle

Symptomdle is a word-guessing game that tests your medical knowledge. Each day, you're presented with a new disease to guess, with symptoms revealed one by one to help you narrow down the possibilities.

## How to Play

1.  **Guess the Disease:** Start by entering any disease name you think might be the day's solution.
2.  **Analyze the Symptoms:** After each guess, a new symptom will be revealed, providing another clue to the correct answer.
3.  **Keep Guessing:** You have six attempts to guess the correct disease. Use the revealed symptoms to inform your next guess.
4.  **Win or Lose:** If you guess the correct disease within six tries, you win! If not, the solution is revealed, and you can try again the next day.
